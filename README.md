# Object Detection using R-CNN

The main objective is to detect the ships in satellite images. Dataset is made up of 4000 80x80 RGB photos labeled with "ship" or "no-ship" classifications and saved as a 19200-item list. These images were extracted from ‘Planet satellite imagery collected over the San Francisco Bay and San Pedro Bay areas of California’.

Multi-step approach in R-CNN:
* Generate region proposals: selective search
* classify the content of the region proposals within a refined bounding box.


# Implementation of RCNN

**Main steps process to implementing an R-CNN object detector:**
1. Build an object detection dataset using Selective Search : data_preprocessing  
2. Apply rcnn algorithm :
 * Basic RCNN based on region proposal
 * RCNN using bounding box 



**Basic RCNN implementation in detail:**
